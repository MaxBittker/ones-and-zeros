<h2>About</h2>

<p>Ones and Zeros asks what <strong>digital literacy</strong> means beyond code.
Our workshops and courses explore computation in the physical world, critical discussions of technology, and its intersection with art and creative spaces.

<!-- <p>"code" focus misses out on opportunties
<p>the way technical concepts are taught, sucks
<p>the culture of the tech industry sucks
<p>most things aren't actually that hard
<p>making stuff is fun
<p>stuff should be well-taught
<p>show how the world works -->

          <p>I found that you made it really approachable. I think sitting here in partners helped, and just seeing how excited you are, it’s like &lsquo;oh ok I can do it&rsquo;. I never thought I would be here doing anything like this ever, and here I am, and I did it, and it feels great, I feel very accomplished today, because of this workshop.</p>
