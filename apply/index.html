        <h3>August 25<sup>th</sup> in Ottawa: Binary Solo</h3>

        <p>In this workshop we'll discover what the 0s and 1s of binary *actually mean*, and how computers use them to store and transmit messages for people!</p>

        <p>We'll decode a famous "binary solo" from a song, edit some code for Arduino (an electronics platform for interactive projects!), print out our own binary messages with thermal receipt printers, and think critically about the social effects of the assumptions built into early computer systems.</p>

        <p>If that sounds like a lot, don't worry! This workshop is geared toward beginners, so you don't need a coding or electronics background to be here :)</p>

        <blockquote class="over-image paperquote">
          <p>Learning about how binary works blew my mind. Being able to write my poetry into binary/hex and then print it out was incredible and really rewarding.</p>
          <cite>&mdash;Ky Pearce, July 2018 workshop in Kingston</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>You'll come away with:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>A deeper and more critical understanding of digital technology and the biases embedded right into how we encode language.</li>
          <li>Skills you can use to make things: power supplies, programming Arduinos, and serial communication.</li>
          <li>A new community of creative people who love making things.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Safe & inclusive environment</h4>

        <p>We strive to create a safe and inclusive learning environment for everyone. Our policies are adopted from the Recurse Center:</p>

        </ul>

        <p>Finally, we believe that good food is a critical part of a good learning environment, and we've got you covered with tasty snack breaks and a nutritious lunch.</p>

        <blockquote class="over-image foodquote">
          <p>Breaks were well timed and delicious.</p>
          <p>I felt accomplished at the end :)</p>
